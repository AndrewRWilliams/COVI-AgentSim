Footnotes:
1,"For Canada and all provinces, except Prince Edward Island, this table replaces the archived table 39-10-0007. For Prince Edward Island and the territories, please see table 13-10-0140-01."
2,"Entries in the life tables represent averages over three-year reference periods. The “Reference period” tab of the drop-down menu on the “Add/Remove data” page refers to the start year of each of the three-year reference periods. For example, the year 2014 represents the 2014/2016 reference period."
3,The life tables for the 1994/1996 reference period onward were updated to incorporate revisions to the population estimates by age and sex since July 1996 and a change in the methodology used to allocate the population of open age groups among ages up to 110 years old.
4,Life tables for the period 2016/2018 are considered “preliminary”. These tables will be updated at a later time to take into account deaths that could have occurred between 2016 and 2018 but have not yet been recorded (late registrations).
5,"Complete life tables, by single years of age, are available for Canada as a whole and for nine provinces: Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia."
6,"For Prince Edward Island, Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, abridged life tables were computed, that is by 5-year age groups. The population sizes of this province and the three territories were too small to allow the calculation of complete life tables with accuracy. The abridged life tables can be found in table 13-10-0140-01."
7,"Average number of years remaining to be lived by persons surviving to age x if those persons would experience, during their lifetimes, the mortality observed over the reference period."
