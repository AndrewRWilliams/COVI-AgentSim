Issues with intervention scheduler -

1. Post lockdown scenarios work with DAYS_SINCE_OUTBREAK as a trigger. PERCENT_INFECTED throws error because of misalignment of current_day_idx in generate_initial_updates.
2. Post lockdown scneraios do not necessarily have to be triggered by PERCENT_INFECTED. One can have LOCKDOWN for 3 months after PERCENT_INFECTED is 5%
3. PREVALENCE is a more realistic trigger. There is no logic for it now.
4. converting to 3 rec levels might be non-trivial because get_rec_level assumes 4 levels
5. normalization might not be trivial because there is a hard-coded value of 4 everywhere
